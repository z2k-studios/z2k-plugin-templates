> The Z2K Templates Obsidian Plugin powerful extension to Obsidianâ€™s native templating, enabling an easy, robust and consistent file creation for your Digital Mind.

---
## Purpose

The **Z2K Templates Plugin** supercharges Obsidian by providing an advanced templating language. Features including smart field replacement, prompting, formatting helpers, YAML integration, partial templates, and URI automation.

---

## Core Features

### Template Fields (`{{FieldName}}`)
- Markdown-native placeholders for inserting data
- Two types:
  - **User Fields**: Prompted at creation
  - **Built-In Fields**: Auto-filled (e.g. `{{today}}`, `{{cardTitle}}`)

### Prompting & Input Control
- Rich inline prompt format to control typing, prompting and default answers for a field.
```md
  {{BookTitle|text|What is the book's title?|Untitled|N/A}}
```
-  Features include:
	- A User Interface that prompts the user for field entries when the template is used.
    - Default values, Prompt Expressions
    - Required fields
    - Data types: text, titleText, number, date, boolean, singleSelect, multiSelect

## Built-In Fields and Functions
- The Z2K Template Plugin provides a rich set of built-in fields and helper functions that enable automation, consistency, and semantic structure in your notes.
	- **Built-in fields** include automatically generated values such as timestamps, dates, card titles, and references to related files (e.g., today's journal or log). These fields are available out of the box and require no user input, making template-driven note creation fast and consistent.
		- `{{today}}`, `{{timestamp}}`, `{{cardTitle}}`

	- **Helper functions** transform and format data during template rendering. They support operations like string casing, date formatting, whitespace control, bulletizing multiline text, and linking fields as Obsidian wikilinks or URLs. These functions follow a Handlebars-inspired syntax and can be nested for advanced logic.
	    - `format-date`, `format-string`, `format-string-to-upper`, `wikilink`, `url`, `format-string-raw`

### Formatting & Helper Functions
- Built-in helpers for formatting and linking:
- Supports nested helper functions

### Partial Templates
- Reusable block templates with filenames prefixed by `Partial -`
- Insert via `{{> partialName}}`
- Auto-merges YAML and resolves fields inline
- Directory-based resolution logic ensures closest partial is chosen

### YAML Field Integration
- Fields can be embedded directly inside YAML frontmatter:
    `card_author: "{{CardAuthor|text|Who is the author?|Unknown}}"`
- Supports System YAML files (`.z2k-system.yaml`) to apply global or scoped template yaml fields across folders

### URI + JSON API Support
- Cards can be created via Obsidian commands or via URI
- URI Example:
    `obsidian://z2k-templates?action=New&templatepath=MyTemplate&filepath=MyCard`
- Supports embedded JSON data for automation and API use
