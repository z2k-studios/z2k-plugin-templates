All Templates used by the Z2K Templates Plugin must be saved in a separate Templates folder. There are two ways to configure your template folders:

1. [[External Template Folders]], where templates are stored in a separate `Templates` folder of your choosing
2. [[Embedded Template Folders]], where templates are stored on a folder by folder basis, embedded within your Obsidian vault. 


> [!NOTE] One or the Other
> These two options are mutually exclusive - you must choose either External or Embedded Template Folders. Similarly, you must have a Templates folder specified somewhere with your vault - as this is the only way in which the Templates Plugin knows what files are Templates and what files are normal cards/notes in your vault. 

To configure which style of Template Folders you wish to use, use the [[Plugin Settings Page]]. You can also specify the name of the root Template Folder as well.
