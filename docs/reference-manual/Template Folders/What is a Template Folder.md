# What is a Template Folder?
Simply put, Template Folders are consistently named folders located within your vault that hold your [[Template Files]].

## Template Folder Naming Conventions
Template Folders are named "`Templates`" by default. 

> [!NOTE] Customized Name for Template Folders
> The [[Settings Page]] includes a setting for changing the name of a Template folder. This is handy for non-English users, for instance.
## What Makes a Template Folder a Template Folder?
The only requirement for a Template Folder is for it to be named `Templates` (or whatever alternative names was specified in the [[Settings Page]]). There are no further requirements. 

## What Do Template Folders Do?
Template folders are the primary method to automatically identify, segregate and contain the template files in a vault. See [[Template Requirements#Standard Method Use a Template Folder|Template File Requirements]] for more details. 

## In a Vault, Is There One Template Folder or Multiple?
This is a design decision for your vault:

### Design Approach: Single Root Templates Folder
If you plan to have only a basic small number of templates, you can put a Templates Folder in the root folder of your vault (or at least the root folder that you specify in the [[Settings Page]]). 

With this design approach, all templates in that folder will be visible throughout the vault when you issue a [[Create new note]] command. 

### Design Approach: Multiple Templates Folders Embedded Throughout
As your vault grows, it may be valuable to create Templates Folders at multiple levels throughout the vault. With this approach, you can more tightly control which templates are useable for different folders within the vault. Please see [[Template Folder Hierarchies]] for more details on this approach.
