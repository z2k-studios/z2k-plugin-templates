title: Why Use Templates?
---
Templates have many uses:
- **Workload Reduction** - template can ease the burden for creating the basic scaffolding necessary for creating a new file in your vault. 
- **Reduce Friction to Capture** - similarly, templates speeds up note-taking by pre-filling structure (e.g. meeting notes, thoughts, daily logs), thereby reducing blank-page paralysis.
- **Consistency in Formatting** - if the content of similar cards use consistent formatting, it will ease the consumption of browsing of your files with predictability.
- **Automating and Standardizing Data Fields** - a template file can specify commonly used YAML properties or dataview fields, thereby minimizing errors due to typos. Many of these fields can be automated through the use of templates.
- **Content Prompting** - templates are great for inserting comments on how to create and organize your content. These comments can then be automatically removed from your new card upon Template Finalization.
- **Improve AI Integration & Queryability** - AI works best with structure. Templates create predictable patterns that AI agents can parse and reason about. This improves search, summarization, and memory-linking workflows.
- **Encourage Better Writing and Cognitive Process** - templates forces users to clarify purpose, insight, and next actions. They reduces the “note graveyard” effect where ideas go uncultivated
