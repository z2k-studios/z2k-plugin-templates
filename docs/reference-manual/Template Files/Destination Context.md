# Destination Context
Throughout the documentation, you will see the reference to knowing the "Destination Context" when you [[Instantiation|instantiate]] a new content file from a [[Template Files]]. In short, this simply means the destination *folder* for the content file. 

But we call it the Destinattion *Context* to help set an important design philosophy in how templates are used. 

## Philosophy
> You must know where you are going in order to begin

If an obsidian vault is small or extremely flat (e.g. a true Zettelkasten), then all of your templates could reside into a single root [[Template Folders|templates folder]] and we would be done with it. The destination for all new notes in the system is abundantly clear. 

But as you create new folders into your vault, they represent different *contexts*, and thus different modes of thinking or subject areas. Thus, when you create new Templates folders in these subfolders, the templates that go into those subfolders reflect the context held within the name of that subfolder. 

The ramification of this design decision is that you must first decision what type of data you want to create before you choose a template because making that decision alleviates the difficulty of finding the template. 

## In Practice
