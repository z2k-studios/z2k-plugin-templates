Inside YANL, it is a constrained environment. I'll come up with some name for that constrained environment. You cannot use block templates or silent helper functions. But helper functions and and fields and built-ins are still supported.  
  
Other places for these constrained environments Include:  
  

- The default, miss, and prompt variables inside field info and it's variants
