# Template Field Naming Conventions
When using Z2K Template Fields, there are some important considerations for how to name a field
- **A Field Name must not contain any spaces**. Thus, `{{Book Title}}` will be interpreted as a field name `Title` with a "helper" function named `Book`, which will likely result in an error. Instead, the field should be `{{BookTitle}}`
- A general convention for field names is that [[Built-In Fields|automated fields]] begin with lowercase (e.g. `{{weekNum}}`) whereas user specified fields begin with an Uppercase letter (e.g. `{{BookAuthor}}`)
- Field names are case sensitive. Fields that only differ by case will still be treated as separate fields. So a field like `{{BookTitle}}` is a different field than `{{Booktitle}}`.

## Special Field Characters
In addition to spaces, a Z2K Template Field name cannot use any of the following characters as they represent other advanced field processing features:

| Character         | Example                                | Implied Feature                                                                                                                                     |
