# Built-in Prompting Helpers

The [[Prompting Interface|default prompting interface]] works great out of the box, but sometimes you may want to more tightly control how the prompt works or appears. You can do just that with the built-in prompting helper functions:

```md
{{field-info CharacterName prompt="Which character do you want to document?" default="Sherlock Holmes"}}
{{field-info CharacterType prompt="What type of character is {{CharacterName}}?"  type="multiselect:Protagonist,Antagonist,Supporting}}
```
