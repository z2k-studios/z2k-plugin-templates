There several built in directives for adjusting how fields are prompted for:

| Function     | Description                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@clear`     | Specifies that a field should clear itself if no data was provided (see [[Finalizing and Miss Handling for Z2K Templates\|Miss Handling]] for more details)    |
| `@preserve`  | Specifies that a field should preserve itself if no data was provided (see [[Finalizing and Miss Handling for Z2K Templates\|Miss Handling]] for more details) |
| `@no-prompt` | Specifies that a field should not be included in the UI to prompt the user for values.                                                                     |
| `@required`  | Specifies that a field is required for input before proceeding. Note: if a default value is provided, then that is sufficient for proceeding forward       |
