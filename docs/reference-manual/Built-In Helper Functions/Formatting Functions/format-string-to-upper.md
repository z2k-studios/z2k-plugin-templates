## format-string-to-upper Helper
If you want to force the data being used for a Z2K Template Field to be rendered in all caps, use the `format-string-to-upper` Helper function:

```
{{format-string-to-upper fieldname}}
```

where:
	- `format-string-to-upper` is the predefined name of the helper function for formatting text to all caps
	- `fieldname` is the name of the field that will receive the data to be capitalized
