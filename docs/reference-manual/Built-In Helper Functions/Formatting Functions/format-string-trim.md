# format-string-trim Helper
If you want to trim any white space at the beginning or end of the text being provided to a field, use the `format-string-trim` Helper function:

```
{{format-string-trim fieldname}}
```

where:
- `format-string-trim` is the predefined name of the helper function for trimming whitespace at the beginning and end of provided data.
- `fieldname` is the name of the field that will receive the data to be trimmed

==todo: use handlebars' fiddler to make sure this helper is actually even needed ==
