# Built-In Field Naming Conventions

> [!TIP] Field Naming Conventions
> Note: In general, built-in fields all begin with a lower case. We suggest that any template-specific fields begin with an Upper Case. For example:
> - `{{fileTitle}}` -- a built-in field for the name of the file
> - `{{BookTitle}}` -- a template field for data to be used in the template.
> 
> See [[Naming Fields]] for more info.
