# now Built-In Field
The `{{now}}` built-in field returns the current date and time. 

==needs updating. This is intended to be another variation of date / today, but just formatted to be the full date and time==

moment().format('LLLL')


> [!TIP] The Now is Sacred
> Think of "now" as being the untouchable root of all date built-ins, and therefore we do not recommend overriding now behavior with field-info. See [[Modifying Built-In Field Behaviors]].
