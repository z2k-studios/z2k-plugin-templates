# What is the Z2K Templates Plugin?

The **Z2K Templates Plugin** automates the process of creating structured, reusable notes in Obsidian. Instead of typing boilerplate content each time, you define templates that contain text placeholders — known as `{{fields}}` — which the plugin resolves into complete notes when executed. Z2K Templates is based on the [handlebars.js](https://handlebarsjs.com) standard for complex field operations.  
No matter how you use Obsidian -- whether you’re logging a meeting, keeping a daily journal, organizing fictional characters, or researching biomedical terms --  Z2K Templates will help you standardize the structure and formatting of your notes and automate the filling in of data for each of your notes.
