# Introduction

The **Z2K Templates Plugin** is a templating engine built for Obsidian that transforms the way you create and maintain notes. Unlike scripting-based systems such as the [Templater plugin](https://silentvoid13.github.io/Templater/), Z2K Templates uses a declarative `{{fields}}` syntax built in [Handlebars.js](https://handlebarsjs.com/), focusing on clarity and structure rather than code. Each field can be filled with data automatically entered from built-in sources, prompted to the user for input, or by pulling data from external JSON and URIs. 

> [!INFO]
> **Context:** Z2K Templates is part of the larger [Z2K System](https://www.z2ksystem.com), a framework for digitizing your mind through structured notes, metadata, and cognition tools. The plugin can also stand alone as a robust, user-friendly templating solution for anyone seeking structure and automation within Obsidian.
