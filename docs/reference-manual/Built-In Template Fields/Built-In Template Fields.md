# Note on Field Naming Conventions
*Note: In general, there is a naming convention used in Z2K to distinguish built-in fields from user specified fields. Built-in template fields all begin with a lower case letter, while we encourage you to denote user specified fields by beginning them with an uppercase letter.*

See [[Naming Conventions]] for more info.
