There are some amazingly cool things you can do with Built-In Fields, like using the [[field-info Helper]] to modify how they operate.

Let's step through some examples - get ready to blow your mind on what's possible.

# Field-Info Modifications

## fileTitle and field-info
By using the [[field-info Helper]] on the `{{fileTitle}}` (and other [[Built-In Fields - File Data#Destination File Fields|title variants]]), you can specify how any resulting file created from the template is to be named.

==todo - flesh in what is possible. Is it just prompt and default? miss? value?==
==will overriding on `{{fileTitle}}` also override on `{{cardTitle}}`?

## what else

==step through every other built-in. Does it make sense to override them?
e.g. the `{{today}}` is probably a no-prompt directive, but can we force a prompt for it?
e.g. can you override the miss for `{{today}}` to change the format of a date from YYYY-MM-DD to MM-DD-YYYY?
e.g. can someone put that field-info entry into system yaml at the root and then make it universally changed?==
