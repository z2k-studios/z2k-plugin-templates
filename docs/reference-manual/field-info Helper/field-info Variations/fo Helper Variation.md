# fo
The `{{fo}}` built in helper function behaves identically to the [[field-output Helper Variation|field-output Helper]]. It is simply an abbreviated name for the helper function, thereby making your templates be tighter in structure and form (at the expense of some readability).

Please see the [[field-output Helper Variation]] for more details.
