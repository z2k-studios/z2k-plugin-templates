# field-info Output
`{{field-info}}` is a [[Silent Helper Functions]], meaning that it does not have any output when it is finalized. Instead it simply disapppears when then resultant file is [[finalized]]

what is the output?
what if you use ~
if it is on a line by itself does it still show the carriage return?
can I list multiple on a line?
what if i want to output the value of the field?
