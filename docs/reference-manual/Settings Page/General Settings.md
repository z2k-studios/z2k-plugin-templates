### Name for Files
We recognize that everyone's vault is a little bit different. Obsidian by default uses the name "note" to describe what a single file is. Others simply call them "files". The Z2K System refers to them as "cards". Heck, you can refer to each file as an "oompah" and we won't judge you for it. 

Use this setting to change how files are referenced throughout the system. 

> [!NOTE] Documentation Note
> All of the documentation for the plugin refers to individual files as "files", so please note that if you change the name for files in your system, there will be small discrepancies in the interface from the documentation.
