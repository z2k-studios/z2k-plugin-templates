## Overview


## Detailed Description of What It Does



### Which Block Templates Appear?
Just like [[Types of Template Files#Document Templates|Document Templates]], the choice of block templates is [[Destination Context|contextually associated]] with the current location of the file in which you are inserted a block template. The picker that appears will go through the same [[Template Discovery]] process to find contextually matching block files relevant to this file. Thus, the block template must be located in a Templates Folder along the path from the current content file up to the [[Templates Root Folder]].

Thus, you do **not** see every block template in the vault - only ones relevant to your current context.
