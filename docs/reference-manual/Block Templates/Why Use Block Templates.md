# Why Use Block Templates?
Block Templates solve several common problems when working with structured notes in Obsidian.

## Consistent Formatting
Block Templates enforce consistent naming and formatting of text blocks across multiple files. Instead of manually copying and pasting (and inevitably introducing variations), you define the structure once and reuse it everywhere.

## Common Use Cases

### Recurring Structures
Add the same structured content to different notes:
- Meeting notes sections
- Overview Sections
- Project status updates
- Review checklists
- Standard disclaimers or notices
- Book Excerpt and Response in Book Reviewz

### Modular Templates
Build complex Document Templates from smaller, reusable pieces:
- Compose a project template from task blocks, milestone blocks, and resource blocks
- Create variations of templates that share common sections

### Quick Data Entry
Rapidly add structured data to existing notes:
- Log entries with timestamps
- Contact information blocks
- Reference citations
- Metadata sections

## DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)

When you need to update a common structure, you only need to change it in one place. All future insertions will use the updated block template. This is especially valuable for:

- Standardized headers/footers
- Compliance or legal text
- Frequently updated reference information

## Compared to Copy-Paste

| Approach        | Consistency        | Maintainability         |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Copy-paste      | Degrades over time | Must find all instances |
| Block Templates | Always consistent  | Single source of truth  |
