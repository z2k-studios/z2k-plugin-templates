# User Defined Helper Functions
Currently, the Z2K Templates plugin does not support registering custom functions (i.e. functions defined by the user). Stay tuned - it's coming.

%% WHEN WE DO SUPPORT IT:

- Emphasize that any helper functions with dates should expect that dates be passed as strings. Further, you should encourage the use of the `{{now}}` built-in to represent the current moment in time, as this is a fully qualified, unambiguous representation of a date + time moment. See the tip inside [[date-add]] as an example.
