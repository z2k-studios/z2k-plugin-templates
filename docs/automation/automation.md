# Automating Your Vault with Z2K Templates

The [[README|Z2K Templates]] is a powerful tool for importing data from other sources. When combined with Apple Shortcuts, automation tools like IFTTT or Zapier, or with custom scripts, your Obsidian vault can become the ultimate final data source for your day to day life. By using the [[Z2K Templates URI Interface]] and the [[Z2K Template Command Lists]] functionality, the world of possibilities can be endless. 

To seed some ideas of what you can do, here are some examples:
- Have today's weather loaded into your daily note each morning
- Record your daily steps and sleep scores in your daily log
- Maintain files in your vault for various lists (bookmarks, songs, books) that you can append to from other apps. (e.g. mark a URL in Chrome to add to your "Future Readings" markdown page)
- Read a news feed for today's headlines and insert them into your morning journal
- Keep track of the music you listened to each day and add them to your daily log
- Keep track of your locations visited each day in your daily log.
- Export notes from voice recordings into new files
- Make a script to provide "lookbacks" to previous years in your current daily note
- Use an automation tool to automatically record when you leave or enter a location into your daily log

This section gives you a hands on introduction for how to build these types of interfaces into your Obsidian Vault.
