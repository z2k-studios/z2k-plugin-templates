# Z2K Templates In-a-Nutshell
The [Z2K Templates Plugin](https://templates.z2ksystem.com) is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) Plugin for making powerful templates for your Obsidian vault:
- It uses the intuitive `{{handlebars}}` syntax to specify where to insert data within a template file and unique prompting interface for collecting data for insertion. No coding like interface required - just  `{{fields}}` written as text in your template files
- At its core, it uses the [handlebars.js](https://handlebars.js) syntax for advanced techniques like [functions](/reference-manual/helper-functions/helper-functions.md) and [formatting](/reference-manual/data-formatting/data-formatting.md)
- Supports a powerful interactive interface to prompt the user for field data
- For advanced users, Z2K Templates also supports creating cards/notes from external datasets through [JSON data and URI commands](/reference-manual/z2k-templates-uri-and-json.md).

Z2K Templates is part of the [Z2K System](https://z2ksystem.com) but works fine as a standalone plugin. We encourage you to check out the greater [Z2K System](https://z2ksystem.com) for how to structure your Obsidian Vault as a digital extension of your mind.
