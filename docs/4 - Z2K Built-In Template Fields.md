# Contents
The following types of built-in fields are available:
- [[#Built-In Template Fields Date and Time|Date and Time]] - built-in date and time fields

# Note on Field Naming Conventions
*Note: In general, there is a naming convention used in Z2K to distinguish built-in fields from user specified fields. Built-in template fields all begin with a lower case letter, while we encourage you to denote user specified fields by beginning them with an uppercase letter.*

(\*1) The `{{date}}` and `{{time}}` built-in fields perform identically to Obsidian's predefinited template variables with the same name. 

## Time and Date Formatting
- In keeping with Obsidian formatting, a optional time format string can be added with a `:` followed by a string ofÂ [Moment.js format tokens](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/). This formatting ability applies only to date and time fields.
- Examples:
	- `{{timestamp:YYYYMMDDhhmm}}` would result in `202601091314`
	- `{{date:YYYY-MM}}` would result in `2026-01`
	- `{{dayOfWeek:ddd}}` would result in `Fri`
- For more details and more advanced formatting, see [[5b - Z2K Template Field Custom Formatting|Date and String Formatting]]
