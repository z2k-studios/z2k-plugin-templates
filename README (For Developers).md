# Z2K Templates Plugin

An Obsidian plugin using the Z2K Template Engine to create new cards and update cards using templates and blocks.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14 or later recommended)
- npm or yarn
- Obsidian (for testing)

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]
cd z2k-plugin-templates

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Template Engine Integration

This plugin depends on the z2k-template-engine module.

```bash
# First, in the template engine directory
cd path/to/z2k-template-engine
npm install
npm run build
npm link

# Then, in this plugin directory
npm link z2k-template-engine
```

TODO: At some point, this should be included as a dependency by either publishing the template engine or using a git tag dep.

### Development
During development, you can keep a terminal open for both the template-engine and the plugin and in each one run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Building
```bash
# Build the plugin
npm run build
```

This creates a bundled `main.js` file that includes the template engine.


### Testing
A testing vault is included in the repository that can be opened in obsidian.
The plugin files are copied into here whenever `npm run build` or `npm run dev` runs so that the plugin shows up.



### Releasing
The script 'release.mjs' has been made to handle most of the steps for creating a new release. Once you have committed all changes and the plugin is ready, run the script using:
```bash
npm run release 0.1.0
```

This will:
- Update the version number in the needed places
- Make a new git commit for the release with the correct tag
- Push the commit to remote (along with tags)

Once this completes,
- Go to the github repository
- Create a new release (on the right)
- Fill out the change log
- Upload main.js, manifest.json, styles.css, and z2k-plugin-templates.zip
